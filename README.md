# 🎯 Vouchie: Turn your Group Chat into a Growth Loop

> **"Transform social streaks into an endless stream of willpower"**

Vouchie is the first **Social Staking Protocol** built on **Base** and **Farcaster**. We turn your personal goals into high-stakes social games. 

Don't just *say* you're going to the gym. Lock $50 on it, tag your best friends as vouchies, and tell them: **"If I didn't make it, lunch on me."**

---

## ⚡ The Vibe

Most habit apps are boring spreadsheets. Vouchie is productivity with skin in the game. Bet on yourself: achieve your goals to keep your stake, or slack off and let your friends take it all.

*   **Win the Day:** Get your money back + earn a **"Verified Vouchie" NFT Badge**.
*   **Flake Out:** Your locked funds get liquidated and **sent directly to your friends' wallets**.

It transforms failure from a shameful secret into "Pizza night is on Alice."

## 🎮 How It Plays

### 1. The Call Out (Stake)
Alice wants to ship a side project in 7 days.
*   She locks **$100 USDC** in the Vouchie Vault.
*   She invites Bob and Charlie to be her **Vouchies** (Verifiers).

### 2. The Grind (Prove)
Alice posts updates via a Farcaster Frame.
*   Bob and Charlie vote: **"Legit"** or **"Cap"**.
*   Real-time notifications keep the pressure on.

### 3. The Verdict (Settle)
*   **Success:** Alice gets her $100 back. She mints a **Vouchie Badge** (Proof of Consistency). Bob and Charlie gain on-chain reputation.
*   **Failure:** The protocol takes a small **Lazy Tax (10%)**. The remaining **$90 is split instantly between Bob and Charlie**.

## 💸 Monetization & Mechanics

We've gamified accountability with three core levers:

### 🩸 The Lazy Tax
If you fail, the protocol takes a **10% cut** before paying out your friends.
*   *Why?* Because failure shouldn't be free.

### 🧊 Streak Freeze
Life happens. Missed a deadline?
*   Pay a **Protocol Fee** to extend your deadline by 12 hours.
*   *Why?* Cheaper than losing the whole pot. Keeps you in the game.

### 🏆 Status Badges
Winning feels good. Showing off feels better.
*   Mint a **Vouchie Badge** upon success.
*   These are **Soulbound Proof-of-Work** artifacts. "I ran 5km for 30 days, verified by 3 humans."

## 🏗️ Under the Hood

Vouchie is a "Headless Marketplace" living entirely in your social feed.

*   **Smart Contracts:** `VouchieVault.sol` (Escrow & Voting), `VouchieBadge.sol` (NFTs).
*   **Network:** **Base** (Fast, cheap, perfectly suited for micro-stakes).
*   **Interface:** **Farcaster Frames** (No new apps to install. Just cast and commit).

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

*   **v1 (Current):** Single goals, USDC staking, Friend-verifiers.
*   **v2 (Vouchie Wars):** Team vs Team. 5 people running vs 5 people running. Winner takes the combined pot.
*   **v3 (Public Markets):** Let strangers bet on your success (Prediction Markets for Habits).
